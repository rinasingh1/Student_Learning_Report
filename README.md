# Student_Learning_Report
## Objective 
A school has asked to analyse its Student Learning Performance report.


## Dataset Used
<a href = "https://github.com/rinasingh1/Student_Learning_Report/blob/main/Student%20Dataset.csv"> View Student Dataset<a/> This project is based on 30641 data points.

## Project Insights
•	The number of female students is more than the male students. 
<br>

•	Parents’ education has a great impact on the children’s education; for example, for those parents having completed higher education (master’s degree), their children    perform well compared to those having completed some high school education.
<br>

•	Parents' marital status has no or negligible impact on the students' learning performance.
<br>

•	The students are comparatively week in mathematics as one student got zero int it, and some attention is also needed to improve the performance in reading and writing   areas. 
<br>

•	Practising mock test before the exams is a good way to perform well. 
<br>

•	A standard lunch has a  positive impact on the performance of students’ education compared to those having reduced or free lunch types.
<br>

•	The first child parameter does not have much impact on the students' scores.

## Conclusion 
•	School can arrange a programme for those students whose parents are not educated enough to support their children’s home learning environment, through this programme they can guide them on topics relevant to the child development and it’s learning performance. 
<br>

•	The school can provide dietary guidelines to have nutritious and balanced meals to ensure a standard lunch for all the students.
<br>

•	To attend tests before exams is very important to score good marks.
<br>

•	To improve marks in the reading and writing area, grammar and spelling formation are main foundations along with practising different text themes. 
<br>

•	Understanding fundamental concepts and practising them on a regular basis are the keys to improving marks in mathematics.
